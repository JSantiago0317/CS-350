# CS-350
The two artifacts I chose to upload were my UART milestone where a user could type "ON" or "OFF" to turn on an LED and my GPIO milestone where my switchboard will blink SOS in morse code until a button is pressed to change it to OK in more code until switched back to SOS. I feel like I created the state machine well. I looked at a lot of examples and went through a lot of trial and error which allowed me to really understand the state machine I wanted to create. I could improve on the complexity of their behavior. I understand that this is a simple school project but I would like to have tried to create something with some complex behavior. I am adding the ability to create functioning code to my support network. I did my best to create clean and obvious variable names along with supportive comments to help others understand what I was trying to accomplish.
